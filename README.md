## About Ylf

Ylf is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- psr/http-message
- use [zendframework diactoros server](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-diactoros/) and [zend-stratigility MiddlewarePipe](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-stratigility/)
- [Simple, FastRoute engine](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [symfony session](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/sessions.html) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).

Ylf is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
